  <li>
    <p><b>How well does the formula work?</b></p>
    <p>It works okay for small matrix sizes, but it significantly underpredicts the time for larger ones (up to about one order of magnitude).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>How close is <var>c</var> computed from the clock speed?</b></p>
    <p>About 20% off.</p>
    <p><b>Is there an integer <var>k</var>&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 such that <var>c</var>/<var>k</var> is a better predictor for your machine?</b></p>
    <p>No, because <var>c</var> is already underpredicted.</p>
    <p><b>Why might <var>c</var>/<var>k</var> be a better value for the formula?</b></p>
    <p>Compiler optimizations, instruction-level parallelism, intrinsics such as fused multiply-add can all contribute to reductions in the time taken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Graph the measured performance.  Are there obvious sudden changes in performance?</b></p>
    <p>Between matrix sizes 200 and 400, there is a noticeable drop by about a factor of two.  Between 1400 and 1600, there is another drop by a factor of two.</p>
    <p><b>What might you do to efficiently find the value of <var>N</var> where the performance has a sudden change?</b>
    <p>Perform more measurements in the nearby area.  Assuming the transition is indeed sharp, it should only take a few careful bisections.</p>
